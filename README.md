# Hamid's Resume

## Ideas
- filter by tags (language, technology)? (wouldn't be man-page-like) => grep?

## TODO
- [ ] update the resume contents
- [x] make the design responsive (mobile friendly)

## Your resume looks funny.
It's actually in the form of a [man page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

## Acknowledgement
The idea and the initial template was forked from Major Hayden's (@major) resume.
